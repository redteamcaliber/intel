Intel
=====

Extract and Vet Indicators of Compromise from both formatted and unformatted input data.

This project is still under development, so currently only the functionality for *Extracting* has been completed. The following indicators can be extracted at this time:

* MD5 Hashes
* SHA-256 Hashes
* IP Addresses
* Domain Names
* Email Addresses

-----

### Requirements

Python 2.7.10
See requirements.txt file.

-----

### Usage

The program accepts one or more input file paths, and will display the results to the console; optionally, you can provide an output file path.

```
usage: intel.py [-h] -i INPUT PATH [INPUT PATH ...] [-o OUTPUT FILE] [-e] [-v]

Used for Extracting and Vetting Intel.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help                                                           show this help message and exit
  -i INPUT PATH [INPUT PATH ...], --input INPUT PATH [INPUT PATH ...]  one or more paths to input file or URL.
  -o OUTPUT FILE, --output OUTPUT FILE                                 optional path to output file.
  -e, --extract                                                        extract intel from input data.
  -v, --vet                                                            vet intel from input data.

### Examples

* [This article](http://www.bluecoat.com/security-blog/2013-11-25/plugx-used-against-mongolian-targets) has good info about PlugX (Chinese backdoor trojan), and how it was used against Mongolia. The blog post can be copied and pasted to a text file, or you can just give the program its URL:

 ```
python intel.py -e -i "http://www.bluecoat.com/security-blog/2013-11-25/plugx-used-against-mongolian-targets"
 ```
 
 OR

 ```
python intel.py -e -i "/Users/Johnny/Test/plugx_intel.txt"
 ```

 * We can see that there are a few legitimate domains that need to be excluded (e.g. yahoo.com), but removing those is much simpler than having to copy/paste each of the indicators from the blog.
